<h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive enhancement was introduced in 2003 in response to graceful degradation. Graaceful degradation was the process of creating websites optimized for the most up-to-date browsers, while largely ignoring the needs of users with older browsers. As the disdain for graceful degradation grew, progressive enhancement took its place. Progresive enhancement focuses more on the content of a webpage and less on design elements. The idea is that websites are built well-meaning content is the foundation-so regardless of how a user is viewing the information they are able to receive it.</p><p>Content is at the center of developing a website then styling with CSS and Javascript are applied to enhance the user's experience. The concept is important because web development is consumer based, therefore user accessibility is the most important part. There is no purpose in creating beautiful websites if they aren't user-friendly at their core. In the following <a href=" https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-progressive-enhancement/"> article on progressive enhancement</a> web developer Joel Adewole explains the importance of progressive enhancement and why web developers should utilize the concept when designing websites.</p>
<h2>Dragon Project Reflection</h2>
<p>
  <p>I got feedback from my sister on the first iteration of my SpaceX dragon project. She mentioned a few concerns, primarily being on the first page. On my homepage I did not center or organize the articles section, so after the configuration heading, everything to her appeared to be jumbled. She also mentioned that there wasn't a lot of detail on any of the pages, that it was a lot of white space, and she could tell it wasn't a real web page.</p>  

 

<p>I did try to address some of her concerns in the project, mainly the confusion on the home page. I created new sections to try and organize the information on that page. I was able to change the fonts and center the article titles so that everything was aligned, and each section made more sense. I did not add more details such as pictures or backgrounds to my web pages. I tried to add a background image using one of the tutorials we were given in class, but I was unable to do so successfully, so I deleted it. I also updated my style sheet to add different fonts to try to make the headers stand out more and I also edited the contact page so that it wasn't so repetitive.</p> 

<p>I learned a lot working on this project specifically. At first, I was still having trouble targeting different elements on the page but during this project I was able to get a lot more practice. Learning to target elements was the most difficult part of the course for me. Another thing I struggled with was the actual design portion of this project (and in previous projects) because I've learned that sometimes the coding part is easier than making the page look good.</p> 

 

<p>Something I think I did well this semester was making the effort to learn on my own. There were a lot of sections I struggled with that I had to look up online and find practice exercises or rewatch the lectures and try to use a pencil and paper and figure out what I was doing. I attended a few classes online this semester and I don't think it's a coincidence that those topics were the ones I struggled with most, just because I learned better in a face-to-face environment so if I were to do something differently, it would be attending class in person unless necessary. If I had to start over something I would do differently is take better notes. I took a lot of notes during the semester but looking back at them wasn't helpful because they're in shorthand and I was writing down what was being said during the lectures, but I wasn't organizing the notes or writing enough detail to actually be able to go back and utilize the information.</p>
